## **A thesis on the future of DeFi, DAOs, and humanity**

**TL; DR:**

* **The world is on fire, and we need to save it.**
* **DeFi can fund our world-saving.**
* **DAOs will do the actual world-saving.**
* **DeFi needs to unite behind the cause of world-saving starting today, or we’ll still be fucked.**

DeFi protocols represent a radically new kind of entity, one that's almost infinitely scalable in income, and at the same time blessed with the freedom to use that income at will. I claim that yield farming DeFi protocols will be the first for-profit non-state entities in history to be truly charitable.

This is a 4 part series of blog posts on saving the world using DeFi and DAOs.

* [Part 0](/post/0) is context on exactly how on fire the world is. It’s optional if you already agree that the world is on fire.
* [Part 1](/post/1) lays out why DeFi protocols are uniquely capable of funding charitable causes. If you want to be convinced that DeFi can actually save the world, this is the part to read.
* [Part 2](/post/2) talks about how a global collaborative network of DAOs, funded by DeFi protocols, can save the world better than existing non-profits.
* [Part 3](/post/3) will be concluding remarks and a call to action.

It's gonna be a long ride, I hope you enjoy it!
