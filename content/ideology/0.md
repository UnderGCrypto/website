## **The ultimate thesis on the future of DeFi, DAOs, and humanity**

**TL;DR:**

*   **The world is on fire, and we need to save it.**
*   **DeFi can fund our world-saving.**
*   **DAOs will do the actual world-saving.**
*   **DeFi needs to unite behind the cause of world-saving starting today, or we’ll still be fucked.**

DeFi protocols represent a radically new kind of entity, one that's almost infinitely scalable in income, and at the same time blessed with the freedom to use that income at will. I claim that yield farming DeFi protocols will be the first for-profit non-state entities in history to be truly charitable.

This is a 4 part series of blog posts on saving the world using DeFi and DAOs.

*   Part 0 is context on exactly how on fire the world is. It’s optional if you already agree that the world is on fire.
*   Part 1 lays out why DeFi protocols are uniquely capable of funding charitable causes. If you want to be convinced that DeFi can actually save the world, this is the part to read.
*   Part 2 talks about how a global collaborative network of DAOs, funded by DeFi protocols, can save the world better than existing non-profits.
*   Part 3 will be concluding remarks and a call to action.

It's gonna be a long ride, I hope you enjoy it!

## **Part 0: The world's on fire, and we can't afford water**

The year is 2020, and what a year it has been. The coronavirus alone has devastated the world economy and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, and it certainly has been enough to make the Australian wildfires--where [up to a third of all koalas](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/27/australia/koala-bushfire-australia-intl-scli/index.html) and [up to a billion animals](https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/01/03/a-statement-about-the-480-million-animals-killed-in-nsw-bushfire.html) have been killed, not to mention people--feel like a distant memory. In the face of these disasters, our governments and politicians have demonstrated just how inefficient, ignorant, and corrupt they truly are, while the robber barons of our age wasted no time to capitalize on the unprecedented human suffering.

The best part? It's all downhills from here.

Within the 21st century, climate change will likely spell the end of human civilization as we know it ([helpful Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ClimateBen/status/1104521158819528704)), killing billions and rendering entire countries uninhabitable, unless our governments tough up on businesses and implement radical measures to reduce carbon emissions and extract existing CO2 from the atmosphere (ha--ha--ha). The inevitable invention of a super-intelligent general AI could help us solve climate change, cure cancer, and establish a post-scarcity utopia, but we still have no idea how to prevent such AIs from killing us all to [make paperclips](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer), or how to prevent a future where the rich monopolize AI-powered armies to enslave the rest of humanity for fun.

Oh yeah, don't forget that in the background, [hunger](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/07/09/last-straw-pandemic-rages-oxfam-warns-12000-could-die-day-hunger), poverty, [wars](https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace), and lack of healthcare are constantly killing millions of innocents every year. And genocidal concentration camps locking up millions of minorities? Of course we couldn't let Hitler and those 20th century folks monopolize it.

So we're all fucked then. Who can be our savior?

Governments, in their current form, cannot be relied upon to solve these problems. Even if we got rid of the incompetent baboons running the show now (which we can't do), the ways our political systems are set up means that politicians are likely always going to be one step behind technological progress ([read the transcript of the 2018 Facebook senate hearing to get a feel for it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/10/transcript-of-mark-zuckerbergs-senate-hearing/)), meaning they're not the best people to put money in the right places. Politicians are also mostly in the pockets of big corporations, especially the fossil fuel industry, who are willing to burn the world down as long as it uses fuel purchased from *their* company. I could go on, but if you're in 2020 like me, just look around and you'll have all the evidence you need.

What about charitable billionaires, like Bill Gates? I assert they also cannot be relied upon. While notable billionaire philanthropists like Gate certainly exist, they're the exception rather than the rule. While most billionaires do donate to charity, most only donate enough to [buy themselves good publicity and keep the people from eating them up](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/12/americas-billionaire-class-donations). The rich don't have the incentive to do good for the public. Simply look at corporate tax-dodging: between \$54.5 billion and \$76.4 billion a year of taxes are avoided by big companies like Apple, Google, and Starbucks every year in the EU alone ([source](https://fortune.com/2016/03/11/apple-google-taxes-eu/)). Meanwhile, [according to the IISD](https://www.iisd.org/sites/default/files/publications/ending-hunger-what-would-it-cost.pdf) **it takes only about \$11 billion a year to end world hunger**. Not mitigate, **end**. The horrible conclusion, therefore, is that **the rich *can* end world hunger and save millions of lives every year, quite easily in fact, but they *won't***. Even worse, Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world with a net worth of \$189 billion, can singlehandedly end world hunger by donating just 5.82% of his wealth every year, which could be easily covered by profit from his investments: [his wealth increased by $13 billion in a single day](https://www.techspot.com/news/86070-jeff-bezos-increases-wealth-13-billion-one-day.html), more than enough to solve world hunger for a year. [Has he](https://twitter.com/HasBezosDecided)?

<img src="images/fuck-bezos.jfif" alt="Fuck Jeff Bezos" style="zoom:33%;" />

(To be fair though, according the the IISD report there's already $8.5 billion per year dedicated to ending hunger as of 2015. It doesn't excuse the inaction of Bezos & co though, another \$11 billion wouldn't have hurt.)

Civil organizations--charities, NGOs, even crowdfunding websites--have been trying to mitigate the huge issues we're facing. Intuitively they're the right people to be solving the issues, and I agree with that, but there's just not enough total resource that can be allocated to them to make a serious difference.

This is probably the most important point in this post, so let me repeat: **There's just not enough total resource that can be allocated to non-profits to make a serious impact on solving the world's issues.**

According to this [Oxfam report](https://assets.oxfamamerica.org/media/documents/FINAL_bp-time-to-care-inequality-200120-en.pdf) ([methodology note](https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10546/620928/rr-time-to-care-methodology-200120-en.pdf?sequence=11&isAllowed=y)),

- "The world’s richest 1% have more than twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people."
- "By June 2019, the world’s wealth was largely concentrated in the hands of the top 10%, who held 81.7% of the wealth–with the top 1% alone holding 45% of the world’s wealth."
- "In 2019, the world’s billionaires, only 2,153 people, have more wealth than 4.6 billion people."

<img src="C:\Users\zefra\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200722141158910.png" alt="image-20200722141158910" style="zoom:33%;" />

This is just stupidly broken. Asking the bottom 90% to donate to charities or adopt a low carbon lifestyle in order to fight climate change, is like asking a homeless person to help fight hunger in Africa: too cruel, man.

On a more serious note. There exists an enormous divide between the haves and have-nots, not just in wealth but also in terms of their interests.

- On one hand, the richest 1% have no incentive to save the world from any crisis, even though they could do so, because they will likely not be affected: just look at how the rich are "[sheltering from coronavirus in luxury retreats with guns](https://nypost.com/2020/05/07/luxury-sporting-retreats-with-hunting-shooting-offer-safe-havens-during-coronavirus/)" as the rest of the world suffers. Furthermore, the rich likely find global crises desirable, as crises are often opportunities for profit; this is already true for [the coronavirus](https://www.gq.com/story/rich-people-getting-richer-coronavirus-pandemic).

- On the other hand, the 99% (or maybe the 90%) have every incentive to save the world from crises, since they will be the most heavily impacted (already true for the [coronavirus](https://time.com/5800930/how-coronavirus-will-hurt-the-poor/) and [climate change](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/26/climate-change-will-hurt-poor-people-the-most-federal-report.html)), but they're also too poor to actually make any serious impact. 

The consequence of this [inadequate equilibrium](https://equilibriabook.com/) we live in is that the civil organizations working on fixing important issues just don't have enough funding. Paradoxically, this would be the case even if an issue was receiving enough funding in total to theoretically be solved; indeed, if you look at [the statistics for charitable giving](https://nccs.urban.org/publication/nonprofit-sector-brief-2018) in the US, there was over $410.02 billion given to non-profits in 2017, with 61.9% of it given to non-religious organizations, which looks like enough money to solve a ton of problems. The issue is more nuanced.

Certainly, there are issues on which not enough money is being spent. Climate change is a big one: according to [this UN report](https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2014_en.pdf), \$5-7 trillion of investments is needed each year in order to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, while if you look at [this US GAO report](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-18-223), "federal climate change funding was $13.2 billion...in 2017", and "94% of their reported climate change funding went to programs that touch on, but aren’t dedicated to climate change, such as nuclear energy research". Globally, only over \$30 billion has been pledged to "multilateral climate finance initiatives designed to help developing countries address the challenges of climate change" ([source](https://climatefundsupdate.org/data-dashboard/)). We'll need to 100x our investments in order to seriously fight climate change.

However, funding is not the only issue: many non-profits are focusing on the wrong things. Not that they're using their money for evil; the problem is that they're doing microscopically good but macroscopically inconsequential things.

Going again to climate change. [En-ROADS](https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?p65=97&v=2.7.19) is a climate change simulator developed by [Climate Interactive](https://www.climateinteractive.org), [Ventana Systems](https://www.ventanasystems.com), and [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/sustainability/), and you can use it to explore the impact of different policies, such as carbon tax and energy subsidies.

<img src="C:\Users\zefra\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200722224836604.png" alt="image-20200722224836604" style="zoom: 25%;" />

If you start playing with it, you'll quickly find that the things many organizations are focused on, like planting trees and promoting electric vehicles, do very little to ameliorate climate change, each only able to reduce the temperature increase by 0.1 degrees Celsius. Less glamorous & much more difficult things, like reducing industrial methane emissions and introducing a high carbon price, do roughly 10 times more impact.

The issue, then, is that non-profits often focus on doing easy things that make people feel better about themselves, such as planting trees or designing cheap ventilators, rather than difficult but effective things that people often don't really understand, such as reducing industrial emissions. Like for-profit organizations, non-profits also have to face competition, since they require funding and attention to survive, so after nature does her selection, **what we're left with are organizations that are the best at attracting funding and attention, rather than those who are the most effective at solving the problems**. This leads to another bad equilibrium where even if enough money was dedicated to solving an issue, because the funding is divided among a large number of small-to-medium organizations working on inconsequential things, we still can't solve the problem.

In order to address this issue, we need to shift the process of natural selection among organizations to one that optimizes for effectiveness. We need to increase the level of coordination among organizations, perhaps even merging many of them, such that they no longer have to face intense competition for attention and funding. We need to change the landscape of non-profits.

## **Part 1: DeFi will eat the world, in a good way**

In order to save the world, we need to secure a massive income stream dedicated to doing good. Given that the richest 10% hold 81.7% of all wealth, it seems reasonable to somehow get our money from them rather than the bottom 90%.

If we take a look at recent history, Internet startups have been extremely successful at doing this. Web 2.0 companies like Google and Facebook have been able to create revenue streams amounting to tens of billions of dollars annually (Google pulled in [$160.74 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266206/googles-annual-global-revenue/) in 2019; [$70.697 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/277229/facebooks-annual-revenue-and-net-income/) for Facebook), most of which coming from ads. They were able to do this within just 20 years, starting from relatively humble backgrounds. Newer startups seem to be doing it even faster: 

- Snapchat achieved more than [$1 billion of revenue](https://www.statista.com/statistics/552702/snapchat-annual-revenue/) in 2018, 7 years after launching in 2011.
- TikTok achieved more than [100 million installs](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1078692/china-tiktok-worldwide-downloads-quarterly/) in under 2 years after their global release, with their parent company ByteDance reaching [$75 billion in valuation](https://www.statista.com/statistics/407888/ranking-of-highest-valued-startup-companies-worldwide/).

These company are, on the high level, doing two things:

- Firstly, they're **transferring value** from the 1% to themselves. More concretely, big & wealthy companies with advertising needs pay these Web 2.0 companies huge sums in exchange for ad placements; likewise for B2B/SaaS companies.
- Secondly, they're **creating value**. Not only are they making products that provide practical value to their users, they're also pulling value out of thin air by gaining stock valuation: the companies themselves are engines of wealth and impact, so the right to share in their profits and influence their decisions is intrinsically valuable.

If we were able to efficiently transfer value from the 1% and create value on our own, just like the Internet startups, and use this newly acquired value for doing good, then even if we couldn't obtain enough value to solve something like climate change, it would be a good place to start, and it would certainly be better than what we have now.

[Green bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/green-bond.asp) is an example of a mechanism that transfers wealth from the 1% to do good. Green bonds are issued by corporations as well as supranational organizations like the World Bank, who dedicate part or all of the proceeds to causes that help with climate change and environmental sustainability. In 2018, [over $167 billion](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/49663417) of green bonds were sold, which is over 15 times the amount sold in 2013.

![SNL Image](https://www.snl.com/articles/396568282.png)

Why is the green bond market seeing such a high level of growth? Because green bonds provide the right incentives. Not only are green bonds on the same level of security and credibility as traditional bonds, as they are backed by the entire balance sheet of the issuing organization, they are also treated favorably by governments, who often offer tax incentives for investing in green bonds. In addition, including green bonds in your investment fund's portfolio is a good way to show that you're environmentally conscious to your investors and the public; good PR is good PR.

The emergence of green bonds demonstrates that the 1% are perfectly willing to spend their money on good--as long as they're getting a decent profit from doing so. That said, it doesn't seem like green bonds are providing sufficient incentives, given the fact that the global bond market is [over $100 trillion](https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/US-Fact-Book-2018-SIFMA.pdf), and the fact that the annual revenue of just Google and Facebook combined easily surpasses the annual green bond issuance. Moreover, the growth of the green bond market is constrained by the balance sheets of the issuing organizations. For these reasons, I don't think green bonds will save the world, but I certainly hope I will be proven wrong on this point.

### DeFi & Yield farming: economic engines for doing good

I claim that yield farming will bring about DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols that not only can attract & create more value more efficiently than the likes of Google and Facebook, but also is capable of voluntarily spending a considerable portion of that value on good. **Yield farming DeFi protocols will be the first for-profit non-state entities in history to be truly charitable.**

I don't want to waste my breath on explaining what DeFi and yield farming are, so here are good places to start:

- [What is Decentralized Finance (DeFi) by EthHub](https://docs.ethhub.io/built-on-ethereum/open-finance/what-is-open-finance/)
- [Yield Farming in DeFi by DeFi Rate](https://defirate.com/earn/)

In case you're too lazy to read them, here is my oversimplified explanation. DeFi, or decentralized finance, refers to financial protocols built on (mostly) the Ethereum blockchain, offering services like lending, exchange, insurance, and so on. Yield farming refers to the practice of DeFi protocols distributing equity tokens to their users based on their usage, which has allowed the protocols to offer extremely attractive return rates for short periods of time, from 50% to 3000% annually.

#### Attracting value through unprecedented cost-efficiency

DeFi protocols are insanely cost-efficient. First of all, once developed and deployed, DeFi protocols require next to no technical maintenance or continuous expenditures. This is because their business logic is implemented using smart contracts, which are run autonomously once they're deployed to the blockchain. Servers? Databases? Don't need them. Don't need to pay for them. If a DeFi protocol was designed by anyone competent, its necessary daily expenditure is exactly zero. You don't even need to hire more people as your protocol grows, since it can run perfectly fine without your help, meaning teams building DeFi protocols can be very small, consisting of anywhere between 1-20 people. (That 1 person team is the legend Andre Cronje)

DeFi protocols not only have zero expenditures, they also have zero cost margins. Namely, providing services to 1 user costs a DeFi protocol the same amount as providing services to 1 billion users: zero. We have seen zero margin companies before: the reason scrappy two-pizza Internet startups have been able to become so successful so quickly is largely due to the fact that they can provide their services at close to zero margins.

Of course, just having zero expenditures and zero margins does not make something automatically successful or powerful: a writer selling ebooks on the Kindle store is zero expenditures and zero margins (at least for the writer), but you don't see writers becoming billionaires in droves or saving the world. The third element, which combined with zero expenditures and zero margins makes DeFi insanely powerful, is right there in the name: finance. DeFi protocols are zero expenditures, zero margins **financial** products. Needless to say, the market size of financial products is orders of magnitude larger than the market size of independent writers.

What happens when you're extremely cost-efficient and fast-moving in a multi-trillion dollar market where your competitors are slow-moving, outdated, and expensive? You fucking win. That's DeFi.

And no, DeFi is not just fintech. Traditional fintech startups, when compared to DeFi protocols, have become part of the slow ones.

- Fintech products have expenditures that scale with the number of users, DeFi has zero expenditures.
- Fintech products have to spend a shit ton of money on lawyers in order to get all the right permits and maintain regulatory compliance, DeFi doesn't, because we're decentralized baby. (What are they gonna do? Sue a DAO containing thousands of random pseudonymous folks from all around the world?)
- DeFi protocols can literally create new assets and classes of assets out of thin air, which fintech products can only dream of doing.

Given these advantages, DeFi protocols can provide better financial products at much lower costs. Moreover, yield farming rewards allows DeFi protocols to provide fundamentally higher returns to investors and liquidity providers. It's just fucking better. As DeFi matures and traditional investors have a better understanding of it, I wouldn't be surprised if tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars will be deposited into DeFi protocols annually in the next 10 years. I predict that DeFi protocols will make the likes of Google, Apple, and Facebook look like small fries in 20 years.

#### Uniquely capable of doing good

DeFi protocols are in a rare situation that makes them uniquely capable of doing massive quantities of good, at least in the near future. For starters, they are competing in finance, a multi-trillion dollar market, making their potential income enormous. In addition, and this is important, DeFi protocols tend to face low competitive pressure, which gives them precious breathing room that the vast majority of traditional corporations and startups can only dream of. This breathing room gives DeFi the free energy necessary to do good.

Why do DeFi protocols face low competitive pressure? Composability. The most important thing that DeFi protocols compete for is liquidity, but liquidity in DeFi is [superfluid](https://tokeneconomy.co/superfluid-collateral-in-open-finance-8c3db15efac), meaning that I could deposit liquidity in protocol A, get some A tokens representing my deposit, and deposit those tokens into protocol B, get B tokens, which I could put in protocol C...rinse and repeat. This is not just theory, it has been going on for months: right now, you could deposit DAI into Compound, get cDAI, and put that into a Uniswap pool to earn trading fees on top of the interest from Compound. You could theoretically go further and put those Uniswap pool tokens into Aave to earn more interest (unfortunately Aave doesn't support the cDAI/ETH pool token as collateral...yet). The superfluiditiy of DeFi liquidity means that the competition for it is not a zero-sum game, making collaboration more sensible than competition.

Moreover, the rise of yield farming has made protocol composition more attractive to liquidity providers than naïve protocols. For instance, Compound rewards COMP tokens to liquidity providers, and Balancer rewards BAL tokens to liquidity providers, so what do you do? You put your money in Compound, get cTokens, and deposit cTokens into Balancer. This way, you earn both COMP and BAL. This means that liquidity providers are actually **incentivized** to put their money in multiple protocols at the same time, further incentivizing DeFi protocols to work together rather than fight tooth and nail. (Further reading: [Aquaponic Yield Farming](https://bankless.substack.com/p/aquaponic-yield-farming))

Because of this low competitive pressure, DeFi protocols can feasibly spend a significant portion of their income on doing good, rather than being forced to spend the money on some silly arms race and falling into [the Malthusian trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_trap). **This property, combined with being zero-expenditures and zero-margins, makes DeFi protocols a radically new kind of entity, one that's almost infinitely scalable in income, and at the same time blessed with the freedom to use that income at will.** Words cannot describe how important and amazing this is.

#### Being good through democratic yield farming

DeFi protocols often release equity tokens, which entitles the owner to governance rights and a part of the protocol's income. Basically like traditional equity, except it's on the blockchain, and it's 100x easier and cheaper to create. Examples include COMP, YFI, AAVE, and BAL. Through creating these equity tokens and decentralizing the governance process, DeFi protocols have been able to amass at least hundreds of millions of dollars of valuation within the span of a couple of weeks, if not days. For example, the YFI token, an equity token released by [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance), saw its market cap grow from \$0 to \$100 million in just 7 days.

<img src="C:\Users\zefra\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200731180857179.png" alt="image-20200731180857179" style="zoom: 33%;" />

The interesting part, and what differentiates DeFi protocols from traditional corporations, is how these equity tokens are distributed. Yield farming distributes equity tokens to users of the DeFi protocol, based on the amount of liquidity or usage they provide. This can be done in different fashions. On one side of the spectrum, we have protocols keeping large chunks of equity tokens for the developers and their investors, nominally decentralizing their protocol but not really, making their setup not much different from traditional corporations. On the other end, we have protocols giving the entire supply of equity tokens is given to the users, resulting in (purported) fair distribution, true decentralization, and emergent grassroots governance, which is best exemplified by yearn.finance and YFI.

**This kind of "yield farming" is interesting, but nowhere near revolutionary or even new**. Both Uber and Airbnb [had plans](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6282445/Uber-Airbnb-reveal-plans-drivers-hosts-equity.html) for distributing equity to their drivers/hosts, though eventually were stopped by the SEC. The idea of distributing equity to users of your product is still operating within the paradigm of corporations, shareholders, and directors. As long as you're still using equity--transferrable and tradable--the distribution of the governance power will eventually resemble the distribution of wealth which, as I've extensively shown in section 1, is stupidly unequal. It will be the same story all over again: a couple of wizkids build an incredibly valuable thing in a garage and become filthy rich, along with their early backers, and choose to spend the new wealth on not saving the world, not solving world hunger, and not fighting climate change.

However, it's a step in the right direction. Giving significant governance power to a large number of people with diverse interests makes the governance system far less likely to do obviously evil things, and opens up the possibility of the system actively doing good things. For example, if the vast majority of Uber shares were held by drivers and riders, it seems far less likely that Uber would still refuse to pay above minimum wage to its drivers, and it might even dedicate a significant portion of its income to providing driver benefits and improving service quality, if the economy permits. Therefore, what yield farming DeFi protocols should implement is actually democracy, where every user has the **right** to participate in the governance process and no individual should have significantly more power than the others, rather than a corporate plutocracy where power lies with the already rich and powerful.

If we want to ensure that DeFi protocols become engines for doing good, we must first pull our heads out of the corporate paradigm. We must start treating DeFi protocols not as corporations but as nations, and start treating the users not as shareholders but as citizens of these new digital nations.

What does this mean concretely? A few things:

- Governance power should be far less liquid. This is for preventing a wealthy party from straight up buying a large amount of legitimate power in the governance system. There are many possible ways to do this, each with different tradeoffs:
  - You could use non-transferrable reputation tokens rather than transferrable equity tokens, though this negatively impacts the yield farming aspect.
  - You could still use a transferrable token, and have a vesting period for the newly minted tokens generated in yield farming. This is not ideal though, since whales could still buy governance power.
  - You could use [quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting) with a transferrable token to limit the power of whales, though an identity system is required for sybil-resistance.
  - You could use a transferrable token with [conviction voting](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475), which is designed to amplify the voice of voters with persistent preferences, prevent plutocracy, while being sybil-resistant. It has some other nice properties too, such as not having last minute vote swings. I'd say this is the best solution of the bunch, except there's no way to vote against a proposal, so it wouldn't work for many systems. It also can't guard against takeover by persistent whales.
- Governance power should not be distributed solely based on the amount of liquidity provided. This is also for the sake of preventing the dominance of whales. There should be multiple ways of being rewarded governance power, such as making code contributions, organizing community events, writing analyses of governance proposals and so on. Something like [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) could also be used for incentivizing community contributions.
- Rather than just focus on nurturing the DeFi protocol, governance systems should have a clear purpose or ideology regarding what it hopes to achieve in the wider world. For instance, a protocol might put "bank the unbanked" as its purpose, and therefore it spends funds on reach-out programs in developing countries. The governance system should never make nurturing the protocol the ultimate end, but a means to achieve its purpose, for a system focused solely on its own perpetuation will never amount to anything *great*.

If we were able to build a DeFi protocol with a *democratic* rather than *plutocratic* governance system, we will unleash a force of good the likes of which the world has never seen. If, on the flip side, DeFi protocols were allowed to grow exponentially while still using a plutocratic governance system, I fear the force we unleash will be one of evil, the likes of which the world has also never seen (well, we kinda have an idea of what it would look like, based on how Facebook etc. turned out). These are two equally plausible worlds, and which one we end up in is up to us.
